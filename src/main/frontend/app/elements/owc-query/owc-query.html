<i>owc-query</i> component is used to set filter in HTTP requests supporting filter parameters, like the HTTP request used to retrive products list

This component is designed to manage the following kind of filters:
<ul>
<li>text filter, which is set by means of text or combo fields;</li>
<li>geographical filter (useful for opensearch queries), which is set by means of area selection on maps;</li>
<li>advanced filters, which can be set by means of text and/or combo and/or checkbox fields.</li>
</ul>
An usage example of 'owc-query' component is reported below

<i>owc-query</i> can be included in a component used to perform HTTP request (e.g. <i>data-source</i> component), specifying an <b>id</b> for it

<pre>
&lt;owc-query id="my-component-query"&gt;&lt;/owc-query&gt;
</pre>

After that, the component can be retrieved using proper Polymer selection component method, in order to set properly the text filter and/or the geographical filter and/or the advenced filters

<pre>
var owcquery         = Polymer.dom(this.root).querySelector('#admin-users-query'),
owcquery.setText(text);  //e.g. text="instrumentshortname: OLCI";
owcquery.setFootprint(footprint); //e.g. footprint = 'footprint:"Intersects(POLYGON((9.048843875000012 39.323305114707296,18.541031375000003 39.323305114707296,18.541031375000003 43.91931457487351,9.048843875000012 43.91931457487351,9.048843875000012 39.323305114707296)))"';
</pre>

Finally, component's parameters can be used to create the HTTP request filter, for instance by means of a specific method implemented in the component where <i>owc-query</i> has been included

<pre>
createSearchFilter() {
    var searchFilter = '';
    if (owcquery.getText() != null) {
        searchFilter += owcquery.getText();
    } else {
        searchFilter += '*';
    }
    if (owcquery.getFootprint()) searchFilter += ((owcquery.getText()) ? ' AND ' : '') + owcquery.getFootprint();
    
    return searchFilter;
}
</pre>
